# CNL: A Compositional Numeric Library

## John McFarlane

### A9.com

???
Hi, I'm John McFarlane.
Today I'd like to talk about numbers.

---

# Background

???
A couple of years ago, I floated the idea of standardizing fixed-point arithmetic.
But the reference implementation grew and grew because I needed to prove that 
you can solve fixed-point in isolation without designing yourself into a corner.
And to do that, I needed to take a stab at solving a bunch of other problems.
--

<img style="float: center; width: 100%; height: 100%" src="github.png">

???
This is the talk about those problems and the solutions I've come up with.
And the library, CNL, where I collect those solutions and work on them.
I'm here to promote a library and efforts to standardize some of these features.
But I've tried to structure it in such a way 
that I share some of the things I've learned about numerics along the way.
Hopefully, you'll leave this talk slightly better equipped to avoid some of the pitfalls of working with C++ numeric types.



---

# The Problem with Integers

???
Lets run through some of those limmitations, starting with integers.
And when I say integer or float, I'm generally referring 
to the fundamental arithmetic types in the C++ language 
which it largely inherits from C before it.
And remember that most problems I list with these types
are something we've tollerated for fifty years.
Given the criticism they come in for, 
I think they're a hugely underappreciated triumph of language design.
--

1. Low resolution

???
Firstly they only count whole numbers.
--

2. Limited range

???
Secondly, they have limited range.
--

3. 'Interesting' behavior of arithmetic operations

???
Thirdly, 'interesting' behavior of arithmetic operations.
There's a lot of that and I'll share a little as I go.
Now lets look at floats.
---

# The Problem with Floating-Point

1. Complicated

   * ± 1.significand * 2 <sup>exponent</sup>
   
   * special values, denormalized values, -0
   
???
There's a lot to know about floats.
John Farrier did a good talk covering floats at CppCon2015.
I recommend that talk if you're curious about floats.
This talk will hardly mention floats. Big topic.
--
   
2. Occasional weirdness can surprise:

   * determinism, associativity, commutativity and ordering
   
???
They do some things which are surprising for a tool used to "do math".
If you swap the sides of a plus or multiply operator, you expect the same result for instance.
You might be surprised by the result when you use floating-point.
--

3. `<cmath>` functions lack `constexpr`
   
???
A bugbear in the era of wanting to make everything a constant expression
is that you cannot write portable compile-time trigonometry using the standard library.
--

4. Variable resolution

???
A floating-point value in the millions range has much lower resolution than a floating-point value in the tens.
This is an aspect of their adaptability but it can have unpleasant consequences.
Basically, they are less precise than they seem.
--

5. Costly in energy and silicon

???
This relates to the first point.
To implement a floating-point unit you need many more times the silicon. Many more times.
And to power those units, you need many more times the energy.
This makes them a poor choice for cloud and embedded applications
where computer per watt is important.
---

# Analysis

???
We'd like to fix everything that's wrong, right?
But that's a tall order. There are trade-offs and diminishing returns.
So I've bitten off a chunk to work on and I hope to show you that it's more valuable than you may have assumed.
--

* Floating-point problems are not *so* bad.

???
Firstly, while floats have their peculiarities, 
they are a fairly self-contained solution to representing real numbers with dynamic range.
Also, most of the problems with floats are hard to solve at the library level.
Many are even hard to solve at the language level.
And many of the biggest problems with floats are that they are too costly and we should make integers easier to use in their place.
--

* Integers are a powerful abstraction over registers.

???
Integers are a powerful abstraction over registers.
And I'm talking specifically about C++'s fundemantal integer types which were inherited from C.
They have some problems.
But I hope to convince you that they are fewer than many people believe.
--

* But we can do a lot better.

???
Nevertheless, some things about `int` can be addressed.
And its usefulness can be greatly extended.
--

* so ...

???
So here's my aim...



---
# Goal of CNL

"**Do for `int` what the STL did for `[]`.**"

???
Do for `int` what the STL did for the humble C array.
--

* Provide zero-cost abstractions over language-level features:

  ```c++
  std::array<T, N> a;  // T a[N]
  std::array<T, N>::iterator i = std::begin(a); // T* i
  ```

???
So, provide zero-cost abstractions over language-level features.
And `std::array` is a great example of this. It's practically just a C array.
The biggest difference is that it fixes one of C's biggest mistakes: decay.
You can pass an array by value without it turning into a pointer.
--

* Maintain a familiar interface:

  ```c++
  auto const& third = a[2];
  for (auto const& element : a) { /* ... */ }
  ```
  
???
Next, maintain a familiar interface.
Stick with what C++ programmers already know.
`std::array` lets you look up values by index.
And you can iterate over its contents the same as with a C array.
The ideal is that this will produce equivalent machine code.
In other words, it provides a zero-cost abstration.
Now of all the components in the standard library, this isn't the most complex.
It's a very lightweight wrapper over a C array.
--

* Allow users to opt in to positive-cost functionality:

  ```c++
  std::array<T, N> a{n};
  auto const& bad_element = a.at(n+1);  // gotcha!
  ```

???
But allow users to opt in to positive-cost functionality.
It's generally a lot easier to take performance away than it is to give it back.
So there are additions that make things safer but come at a cost.
The user can choose to use these if they choose.
But crucially, if they don't use them, they don't pay for them.
--
  
* And most importantly...

???
And most importantly ... well -- for this talk at least -- 
it's not really mentioned so much because you take it for granted when you start using class templates...
---

# Goal of CNL

"**Do for `int` what the STL did for `[]`.**"

* Compose!

  ```c++
  using fs_cache = unordered_map<filesystem::path, vector<byte>>;
  ```

???
Compose!
You can take the components of the STL and you can combine them with each other.
And crucially, you can combine them with other things that aren't the STL.
I just threw this type together. 
You can look at this line and it tells you a heck of a lot.
If you're comfortable with class templates, you can quickly guess what this type is for.

But like any high quality tool, the STL doesn't try to do everything.
So there's a complement to this rule...
---

# Non-Goal

"**Don't do for `int` what STL doesn't do for `[]`.**"

???
"Don't do for `int` what STL doesn't do for `[]`."
Pretty vague, right?
What do I mean by this?
--

* Don't make the user pay for what they don't use.

???
I mentioned this before. 
It's very tempting to look at the arithmetic types provided by the language
and decide you going to fix them.
But how you go about that is crucial.
First you have to understand what is broken.
Time for some code.
---

# Fixed-Point Arithmetic

Definition:

```c++
// cnl/fixed_point.h
namespace cnl {

    template<typename Rep = int, int Exponent = 0>
    class fixed_point {
        // ...
    private:
        Rep r;
    };

}
```

???
Here is the declaration for the fixed_point class.
This class does one, very simple job:
it adds a decimal point to an integer.
It's rather more than I've listed here. 
The full interface makes it behave mostly like the integer with which it is specialized -- `int` by default.
In fact, if you leave the defaults, you get something that behaves as much like an int as I can manage.
This may seem surprising. Surely it should be more like a float. It's got "point" in the name!
That's true, but it also has "fixed" in the name and all integers are fixed-point numbers.
Fixed and inflexible.
--

Example usage:

```c++
using cnl::fixed_point;

void f() {
    auto n = fixed_point<int, -8>{ 0.25 };
    std::cout << n * 5; // prints "1.25"
}
```

???
Here's how you use it to define a fixed-point number.
I'm using a modern style here with `auto` and uniform initialization.
That's mostly a style choice.
But I'll get back to that.

Anyway here, n is an int -- only it's worth 8 bits less than normal.
So the actual value stored is 64 and then it's divided by 256 to get 0.25.
And when you multiply it by an integer, nothing special happens. 
The result is 64 times 5 which is 320.
And 320 over 5 is exactly 1.25.

This is a very thin wrapper over integers.
Like std::array, it's only adding one little thing to an existing language feature.
And this is a good thing. But to explain why, you need to know what you're getting.



---
# The Good

???
Lets start with the good news.
A thin wrapper tends to give you the least costly abstraction.
In this case, `fixed_point` gives you the same performance as `int` which is hard to beat.
--

```c++
bool foo(float f) {
    auto fixed = fixed_point<int, -16>{f};
    auto fixed_plus_one = fixed + 1;
    return fixed_plus_one > fixed;
}
```

???
Because we're essentially performing signed integer arithmetic,
an optimizing compiler reduces this function down to...
--

```c++
bool foo(float) {
    return true;
}
```
???
this.

And here's the assembler.

And remember the previous example that prints 1.5?

???
Here is is next the equivalent hand-written equivalent.
I'm 



Here's that code again along with the hand-written equivalent.
It's not a very challenging piece of computer code to optimize.
And as always, you need an optimizing compiler that's good at inlining to pull this off.

Note that I got this to compile with GCC 4.8. This is quite an old compiler. 
It isn't even C++11-complete. 
A lot of CNL doesn't work so great with GCC 4 and I don't currently even test against it. 
But when it works, it's possible to make it zero-cost.



---
# The Bad

???
But `int` is a sharp tool.
You can easily cut yourself if you're careless.
--

```c++
// undefined behavior
auto a = numeric_limits<fixed_point<int, -16>>::max() + 1;
```

???
It's not safe to exceed the range of an `int`.
Therefore it's also not safe to exceed the range of a `fixed_point` of `int`.

Now, I'd like to share one of my favorite C++11 features with you at the point.
--

```c++
// compiles
static_assert(1 == 1, "this does compile");

// error: static assertion failed: this does not compile
static_assert(1 != 1, "this does not compile");

// error: left shift count >= width of type
static_assert(1 << 1000, "this does not compile");
```

???
It's called `static_assert` and I use if lots. 
Just grep for `static_assert` in the CNL test target to see what I mean.

`static_assert` provides a great way to test your code.
You can use it to test any constant expression.

The first expression here will compile fine because the expression is `true`.
The second one fails to compile because the expression is `false`.
The third one fails because the expression is not a constant expression.
Expressions with undefined behavior in them cannot be a constant expression.

CNL uses `constexpr` throughout so most of it can be tested using `static_assert`.
--

```c++
static_assert(numeric_limits<fixed_point<int, -16>>::max() - 1, "OK");
static_assert(numeric_limits<fixed_point<int, -16>>::max() + 1, "error");
```

???
When I pass the former of these two `fixed_point` expression to `static_assert`,
it falls into the third category.
You can catch a lot of errors this way and use it to learn how to write the correct code.
Use `static_assert` and `constexpr`!

Lets looks at another example...



---
# The Bad

```c++
static_assert(fixed_point<unsigned>{1} < fixed_point<signed>{-1}, "OK(!)");
```

???
This line compiles!
Pretty bad huh?
Why? Why does fixed_point have underfined behavior? 
Why does one appear to be less than minus one here?
Both questions have the same answer.
--

```c++
static_assert(numeric_limits<int>::max() + 1, "error");
static_assert(unsigned{1} < signed{-1}, "evaluates to true");
```

???
The answer is because it's `fixed_point` of `signed int` and `fixed_point` of `unsigned int`.
Integers are already doing this.
So when you instantiate `fixed_point` using built-in integers, these behaviors come along for the ride.
If you want something different, you need to instantiate using a different type.
We'll see this later.

One last thing. I'd like to introduce a couple of C++17 features.
--

```c++
static_assert(fixed_point{1u} < fixed_point{-1});
```
???
Here is the same `signed`/`unsigned` comparison in more terse C++17 form.
All termplate parameters are being deduced from constructor call.
The left-hand side is deduced as being a `fixed_point` of `unsigned` because of the `1u` there.
And there is no second string parameter for `static_assert`.

Anyway, so that's the bad.



---
# The Ugly

???
Time for the ugly.
And this is going to be a foray into division.
But I'm going to ease you in gently with some multiplication.
--

```c++
auto n = fixed_point<int, -8>{1.5};
auto nn = n * n;    // fixed_point<int, -16>;

static_assert(std::is_same_v<decltype(nn), fixed_point<int, -16>>);
```
???
So what do you get when you multiply fixed_point values.
Well, remember, this is just integer arithmetic under the hood.
And when you multiply numbers, you add exponents. 
So we get a result with an exponent of minus eight plus minus eight.

Note I'm using `static_assert` here to test that the result type is what I expect it to be.

So why not just convert back down to minus eight? 
That the input type right?
Well, that's extra work. It looses precision. 
And what if your two inputs have different exponents?

These are some of the tougher issues I've had to wrestle with when designing the operators for this type.
But the bottom line, is I'm trying to do the minimum work.
---
# The Ugly

???
And here we see what a simple multiplication operation reduces down to.
To recap: `fixed_point` only does one thing: scaling.
It's nice because you see that 65536? It's easy to forget that the scale changed with the multiplication.
But the multiplication itself is exactly the same as the naked integer equivalent.

What has this got to do with division?
Well...



---
# The Ugly

???
...where multiplication sums exponent, so division subtracts it.
That's a big problem in a lot of cases.
Take this example:
--

```c++
constexpr auto n = fixed_point<int, -8>{1.5};
constexpr auto d = fixed_point<int, -8>{2.25};
constexpr auto q = n / d;    // fixed_point<int, 0>;
```
???
Here, we subtract minus eight from minus eight to get zero.
That means we have no fractional digits. It means that `q` is rounded down to zero.
This is terrible right?
Well, we're performing integer division -- which is a different beast to floating-point division.
If you pick two random integers and divide one by the other, you get zero in round fifty percent of cases.

And `fixed_point` just scales integers, it doesn't magically make integer division work well for numbers with decimal places.
--

```c++
constexpr auto n = fixed_point<int, -8>{1.5};
constexpr auto d = fixed_point<int, -8>{2.25};
constexpr auto q = cnl::divide(n, d);    // fixed_point<long, -31>;
```
???
I've added a helper function that does fancy expensive divide.
It requires a little explanation.

    

---
# How Do You Solve a Problem Like Division?

???
When you multiply two numbers, you get something twice as wide.
--
```c++
5.5 * 5.5 = 30.25
55. * .55 = 30.25
```
???
Two plus two is four.
Just as you add the exponents of the operands to get the exponent of the result, 
so you add the widths of the operands to get the width of the result.
--

???
When you divide two numbers, you get an unholy mess.
--
```c++
1 / 100 = 0.01
10 / 5.5 = 1.818181818181...
```
???
It's very easy to get something that isn't expressible in binary or decimal or any other base.
At this point, we need a fraction type.
--
```c++
template<typename Integer> class fraction { Integer numerator, denominator; ... };
```
???
Sorry, I haven't written that one yet.

But roughly speaking, division follows a similar trend to multiplication
in that you put two operands in on the right and you get something out on the left that's got twice the informational bulk.
--
```c++
AAA.BBBBB * CCCCCC.DD = AAACCCCCC.BBBBBDD
```
???
Here's what you get when you multiply two 8-digit numbers with different exponents.
By the way, you don't just copy those digits and paste them together like a collage. 
That would be nice.
No, that's how they contribute to the resultant width.
For division...
--
```c++
AAA.BBBBB * CCCCCC.DD = AAADD.BBBBBCCCCCC
```
???
...observe the difference here.
The mathmatical term for this is a switcheroo.
The divisor (which is the C.D) results in more integer digits if it has more fractional digits.
And vice verse.

This is what `cnl::divide` does to your `fixed_point` operands.
--
```c++
constexpr auto n = fixed_point<int, -8>{1.5};
constexpr auto d = fixed_point<int, -8>{2.25};
constexpr auto q = cnl::divide(n, d);    // fixed_point<long, -31>;
```
???
And it's a bothersome job.
Firstly, there needs to be a wider type.
So if your operands are 64-bit and you don't have 128-bit integer support enabled, `divide` won't compile.
Then, the numerator needs to be shifted a whole bunch to the left so that when the integer division occurs
and the denominator exponent is subtracted from the numerator, that the result observes switcheroo semantics.

Assuming `int` has 31 digits, and we're multipling two numbers with 8 fractional digits like before,
that means 23 integer digits. This one's symetrical.
Result has 23 plus 8 integer digits and 8 plus 23 fractional digits.

This solution is relatively complicated to understand and implement.
It's costly at run-time, limited in how wide you can go with native types, and not portable.
For instance, if you're on a system where `int` is 64 bits, or you use `long` on Microsoft and then port to GCC
you at least get different results or your code stops compiling.

This is why `cnl::divide` isn't the default behavior for the division operator.
This in turn makes it very hard to replace your floating-point arithmetic with `fixed_point`.
However, I've tried harder than this.
Are you ready for the most awesomely lame metahpore in the library.

# Elasticity

???
Elasticity!
I haven't explored promotion and implicit conversion yet
but they're another 'interesting' feature of fundamental integers.
--

```c++
auto n = fixed_point<uint8_t, -8>{0.99609375};
auto nn = n * n;
```

???
Here's a fixed_point type cannot represent one. 
Its range is zero to one exclusive and its resultion goes down to a two hundred and fifty sixth.
`n` is the maximum positive value of this type.
Under the hood, `n` is mostly likely an unsigned char with value of 255.
I'm taking `unsigned char` 255 and multiplying it by `unsigned char` 255.
So what happens at run-time and at compile time to `nn`?
Does it overflow?

# Elasticity

```c++
auto n = fixed_point<uint8_t, -8>{0.99609375};
auto nn = n * n;    // fixed_point<int, -16>{0.9922027587890625};
```
???
No. Because integers are promoted to the width of an `int` before any math is performed on them.
If you, like me, programmed for many years and did not know about this,
then you surely avoided writing a load of bugs by sheer good luck and some very pragmatic language design.

However, 32 bits isn't that much these days.
So when I do this:
--

```c++
auto n = fixed_point<int, -31>{0.99609375};
auto nn = n * n;    // fixed_point<int, -62>{?!?!?!?!?!?!};
```
???
This is a disaster.
We lost the top half of the number. This is signed overflow. It's undefined behavior. You cannot put this in a `static_assert`.
If `int` was unsigned instead, it would be defined behavior but the result would be totally wrong.

It seems that what we want is an integer with consistent rules about how and when it promotes to a wider type.

# Elasticity

```c++
template<int Digits, class Narrowest = int>
class elastic_integer { WideEnoughInteger r; /* other stuff */ };
```
???
Here is `elastic_integer`.

--
```c++
#include <cnl/elastic_integer.h>
using cnl::elastic_integer;
auto e = elastic_integer<31>{0x7FFFFFFF};   // r has 31 or more digits
```
???
Here is an elastic integer. 
It's *probably* going to resolve down to an `int` with maximum value.
Your architecture may vary.
What happens when I multipy with this?

--
```c++
auto ee = e * e;   // elastic_integer<62>{INT64_C(0x3FFFFFFF00000001)}
```
???
What happens is that we break the 32-bit barrier -- as I call it.
I could give a whole talk on elastic_integer.
Note that when you add numbers you need one extra bit.
--
```c++
auto _2ee = ee + ee;   // elastic_integer<63>{INT64_C(0x7FFFFFFE00000002)}
```
???
Now would be a good time to point out that CNL is just a bunch of other peoples ideas copy-pasted to look like a coherent library.
The foundation for all of those `fixed_point` operations was already figured out when I found it in Matheus Izvekov's fp library.
And the credit for the idea of a type which automatically widens results at compile time to avoid overflow goes to Lawrence Crowl.
He'd been working to standardize fixed-point arithmetic for years before I got interested in this stuff.
He also proposes combining this feature with fixed-point arithmetic (among other things) to make one super-type.
But I'm not done stealing other peoples ideas yet.
Here's how I think an STL-inspired library should achieve this.
--
```c++
auto fpe = fixed_point<elastic_integer<31>, -31>{0.99609375};
```
???
Up until now, I've been composing library types from fundamental integer types.
But in CNL, compositional means a whole lot more than that.
Here, we've made a composite type which addresses two concerns in unison.
The concern of tracking exponent is addressed by `fixed_point`.
The concern of ensuring results are wide enough is addressed by `elastic_integer`.
And when you perform multiplication...
--

```c++
auto sq = fpe * fpe;  // fixed_point<elastic_integer<62>, -62>{0.9922027587890625}
```
???
You get the right answer.
This is powerful stuff.
This required no extra plumbing to work and what you get is lossless real-number approximation with a minimum of run-time integer arithmetic.

Sadly, the story is not so plain and simple when we return to division.
Remember I said one of the problems with our 'nice' divide operation is that it's not portable?
That's because the number of integer digits in types like `int` and `long` are not the same across all platforms.
Well, `elastic_integer` solves that problem.
And `fixed_point` of `elastic_integer` is a safer type.
Just like `std::array::at`, it's a comfort feature that users can opt into if they want a little more safety.
Sometimes it'll use more bits than you actually need but that's OK.
So I feel as if it's not so much of a stretch to introduce safer, slower division as the default for elastic `fixed_point`.
So lets take `sq` here and divide it by itself.

--
```c++
#include <cnl/auxiliary/elastic_fixed_point.h>
auto q = sq / sq; // fixed_point<elastic_integer<124>, -62>{1}, q), "");
```
???
Sorry it's just an unexciting result. 
One. We're using 124 bits to express the value one.
That's what I mean by "more bits than you actually need"

It actually rounds up to 128 bits.
Don't try this in Microsoft's compiler because it doesn't support non-standard 128-bit integers.
Under common conditions, GCC and Clang can do this.
I fully expect Abseil's 128-bit type to work with this but I haven't tried it yet.
Arbitrary width types is a concern which the numerics study group has on the agenda 
but it's still on the TODO list for CNL.

Also note that I've had to include a header with a custom `operator/` here.
These are warts in the design. 
It's imperfect.
But I think that elastic_fixed_point hits a sweet spot in terms of efficiency and usability
and I think it's got a lot of potential.

But this type alone cannot avoid overflow because not all C++ math is static and functional.

# Run-time Safety

???
And by that I mean what happens when you actually want to mutate an existing value?
--
```c++
#include <cnl/safe_integer.h>
using cnl::safe_integer;
auto i = safe_integer<uint8_t>{255};
```
???
Well, here's a third type. It's called `safe_integer`.
It's job is to catch and handle run-time overflow conditions.
It assumes you're using your integers to express quantities 
and that you don't want to exceed the range of those integers.
--

```c++
auto j = i + 1;
```
???
What do you think happens when I add one to a maxed-out 8-bit integer?



---
# Run-time Safety

```c++
#include <cnl/safe_integer.h>
using cnl::safe_integer;
auto i = safe_integer<uint8_t>{255};
```

```c++
auto j = i + 1; // safe_integer<int>{256}
```

???
Seems like a trick question right?
It really shouldn't be. 
Once you understand the peculiarities of C++ integers
and once you understand what is required to write generic numeric types in C++,
it should be second nature to expect the result of arithmetic operations to be `int` width.

If you thought this was just the new-fangled modern equivalent to this...
--

```c++
safe_integer<uint8_t> k = i + 1;  // throw std::overflow_error
```
???
Then again, you need to understand what C++ is doing to your types.
This is a great reason to consider using `auto` more.
This code is doing more work. The addition promotes to `int` width.
And then the assignment converts back down to `uint8_t`.
And finally we see `safe_integer` earn its reputation.
By default, it throws on overflow.
And if you try and do this in a constant expression, e.g. a `static_assert`, you get a compiler error.
--

```c++
constexpr safe_integer<uint8_t> k = i + 1;
static_assert(cnl::_impl::identical(safe_integer<int>{256}, k));
```

```

and so on...
???
I know, I need to do some work on making errors more readable in my library.
C++ also needs to get better at producing compile-time error messages.
It's something that takes a lot of work. 
But my priorities are correctness, efficiency and usability in that order.
And CNL is not completely done yet.

Needless to say, you can create other composite types with `safe_integer`
by, for instance, combining it with `fixed_point` and `elastic_integer`.
But there's a lot to get through. See my CppNow talk for more on that.

# Deduction and UDLs
???
One of the big C++17 wins for CNL is class template deduction
--

```c++
auto x = fixed_point{42ul}; // fixed_point<unsigned long, 0>{42}
```
???
I've shown this previously.
In this example, the literal `42ul`.
Most of the time, your literals are at least 32-bits wide.
So this kind of thing...
--
```c++
auto y = fixed_point{128};  // fixed_point<int, 0>{1}
```
???
is wasteful.
It's another example of many bits being used to express just one.
--
```c++
using cnl::literals;
auto z = fixed_point{128_c};  // fixed_point<int, 7>{128}
```
???
So there's a user-defined literal for `integral_constant`.
Two things to note here: firstly, the `_c` on the 128 there.
That means that literal is an `integral_constant`
which means that it's a template with 128 as one of the template parameters.
This in turn means that `fixed_point` can use a deduction guide which picks a type with the right exponent.
That's the other thing to note: `z` has a positive exponent.
It's just an `int` with value one under the hood.
Lets use some binary literals to make things a little clerer
--
```c++
auto a = fixed_point{0b10000000000000000000000000000000000000000_c};  
// a === fixed_point<int, 40>{0b10000000000000000000000000000000000000000l}
```
???
This number wouldn't normally fit in an `int`.
But the positive exponent exploits the fact that all of those lower bits are zero.
When they are not zero...
--
```c++
auto b = fixed_point{0b11111111111111111111111111111111111111111_c};
// b === fixed_point<long, 0>{0b11111111111111111111111111111111111111111l}
```
???
The deduction guide picks a wider type.
--


---
# Deduction and UDLs
???
So `_c` in combination with `fixed_point` ensures that you aren't wasting any low bits.
And `elastic_integer` is great at ensurint you don't waste any high bits.
--
```c++
auto c = elastic_integer{2017_c}; // elastic_integer<11>{2017}
```
???
For instance, `2017` fits into 11 bits.
But what about composite types?
That's a lot harder.
There really isn't enough information in a literal to convey what composite type you want.
But you can define a different literal for each composite type you want.
--
```c++
auto e = 0x7f000_elastic; // fixed_point<elastic_integer<7>, 12>{0x7f000}
```
???
Here is an elastic fixed-point number that uses 7 bits.

Generally, user-defined literals and integral constants are an exciting area.
Another neat trick I borrowed from Matheus Izvekov's fp library 
involves applying the shift operator to fixed_point values.
```c++
auto s = e >> 1_c;  // fixed_point<elastic_integer<7>, 11>{0x3f800}
```
???
Because a `fixed_point` variable is already shifted by a static amount,
it's a nop to shift it by another static amount.
Here, I'm halving the value of `e` to get `s` 
but under the hood, the value is exactly the same. 
It's just the type that's changed.

This is stuff that, say, embedded developers have to do from time to time.
It's trivial on the face of it but I find that sometimes the simplest tasks are the most error-prone.
There's a psychology experiment called the four card problem which illustrates how humans are terrible at abstract operations.
It's fascinating stuff.
Jason Turner easlier was complaining about confusion caused when things are not-`noexcept`. 
That's a great example. Double negatives are sometime far more confusing than double-precision floats.
Sometimes I find `bool`s more confusing than `int`s and `int`s are more confusing than `float`s.
Cognitive load is a limited quantity to a programmer and anything we can do to lighten that load and put it on machines is worth exploring.

So far I've talked about fundamental integers 
and I've talked about the types you can make from those and CNL types.
I'd briefly like to talk about other types from third party libraries that I've tried to combine with CNL.

# Interoperability - Boost.Multiprecision

```c++
#include <cnl/auxiliary/boost.multiprecision.h>
using namespace boost::multiprecision;

template<int NumBits, int Exponent = 0>
using mp_fixed_point = cnl::fixed_point<
        number<cpp_int_backend<NumBits, NumBits, signed_magnitude, unchecked, void>>,
        Exponent>;
```
???
So this is a bit of a screenful.
`mp_fixed_point` is a `fixed_point` type which uses Boost.Multiprecision for its integer.
--

Fixed-Point + Boost.Multiprecision:
???
I've played with it a little.
--

* googol (10<sup>100</sup>) ✓

???
I've used it to store a googol which is a 1 followed by a hundred zeros.
This isn't a huge deal because that's a whole number.
Boost.Multiprecision can already do that.
--

* googolth (1 / googol) ✓

???
So then I got one over a googol to get a googolth.
That's a little more impressive.
I think it's only an approximate value because binary isn't too great at decimal fractions.
But one thing I haven't tried is ...
--

* googolplex (10<sup>googol</sup>) ✗

???
Sadly, a googolplex is beyond the range of this type.
The reason is that both libraries use built-in integers to express the number of digits
and there isn't a built-in integer type that can hold a googol.
It has to be a built-in integer because it's a non-type template parameter.
This is why we urgently need to lift the limit on what can be a non-type template.
This is the compelling use case Bjarne was asking for last night during the Grill the Audience panel.
HOW ON EARTH can we be expected to easily express a googolplex at compile-time with such a limited choice of non-type template parameters?
It's an outrage.

Seriously, there are a tonne of possible future language features that will affect how math is done with libraries like CNL.
Concepts, contracts, the spaceship operator and metaclasses will all have a significant bearing on how numeric types are written and used.
But it's really in C++11 that a lot of what is currently possible came on line.
Apart from the deduction guides, you can use virtuall all of the features of CNL with a C++11 compliant compiler.

# Interoperability - Boost.SIMD

```c++
#include <cnl/auxiliary/boost.simd.h>
using boost::simd::pack;

template<class T, std::size_t N, int Exponent>
using fixed_point_pack = fixed_point<pack<T, N>, Exponent>;
```
???
So for anyone who's used SIMD to make their calculations happen in parallel on a single thread,
you may have been subjected to many vecdor-specific intrinsics 
that make you feel like you're writing assembler all of a sudden in your compiler.
Boost.SIMD is an answer to this. I wraps all those specifics in generic C++ class templates.
In this code, you can think of `boost::simd::pack` as a little like a `std::array`.
It contains a fixed number of `int`s or `float`s.
But it has a set of operators that hook into all those powerful intrinsics.

It's very intense stuff and a great example of a numerics library 
which exploits template metaprogramming to get high performance at run-time.
It also needs to run on a lot of compilers -- some of which are pretty old.
Joel Falcou will be talking on Thursday at 3.15 on this topic.
That should be an very enlightning talk.

Anyway, I sat down earlier this year and tried to connect these two libraries.
One trivial pull request later, I had pretty good functionality!
There's still some work to do to get the sorts of performance gains one might expect.
But you can write code like this:
--
```c++
using fpp = fixed_point_pack<int, 4, -16>;
using initializer = initializer<fpp>;

auto expected = fpp{initializer{7.9375+-1, -8.+.125, 0+-5, 3.5+-3.5}};
auto augend = fpp{initializer{7.9375, -8., 0, 3.5}};
auto addend = fpp{initializer{-1, .125, -5, -3.5}};
auto sum = augend + addend;
```
???
I'm using `initializer` here so that I can

# CNL Today and Tomorrow

???
So where is CNL? What's left to do?
Well it's potentially a substantial library.
I'm chipping away at the features I want to see most.
Sometimes people put in feature requests or pull requests and I try and prioritize those.
--

[`github.com/johnmcfarlane/cnl`](https://github.com/johnmcfarlane/cnl)

???
I'd appreciate any help I can get. 
The best thing people can do is clone the library and try and use it.
--

* Arbitrary width

???
Especially with compound expressions that have a lot of multiplication,
you run out of bits fast if 64 bits is your limit.
GCC's `__int128_t` and Abseil's 128-bit class help
but a general purpose solution would be really nice.
There is a paper circulating that aims to address this.
--

* Full Support for Rounding and Overflow

  ```c++
  template<class Rep = int, class RoundingTag = closest_rounding_tag>
  class precise_integer : public _impl::number_base<precise_integer<Rep, RoundingTag>, Rep>;
  ```

  ???
As you can see, I concentrate on `fixed_point` and `elastic_integer`
because they are the most machine-friendly way to deal with rounding and overflow.
But there's a lot of demand for a `safe_integer` type.
I didn't even get around to showing you the `precise_integer` type.
But that's available to try out also.
And then how do allow people to add their own custom rounding and overflow modes?
The requires the design of an API which is currently placeholder.
--

  * Full complement of operators for `safe_integer` and `precise_integer`
???
Just to warn you, there are holes in the set of operators I've written so far.
It's a huge set:
there are all the arithmetic, comparison and logic operators for each type.
And in writing and testing these, Interoperability issues fall out that need to get addressed.
It's a lot of work.
--
  
  * Full complement of free functions

    ```c++
    add(saturated_overflow, UINT32_C(0xFFFFFFFF), UINT32_C(0x12345678))
    divide(closest_rounding_tag, 2, 3);
    ```

???
As well as types to solve these problems, there are free functions that should be able to solve them also.
It's a big task to write these.
Compiler vendors help a little here with intrinsics but their lists are incomplete as well.
And then there's the problem of writing generic versions of these which work efficintly for composite types.
--

* Better Literals

  ```c++
  auto a = 0b1111.1111_elastic;  // fixed_point<elastic_integer<8>, -4>
  ```

???
I'd like to add literals with a decimal place. 
This poses some problems.
It's already quite difficult to parse these strings in C++11.
It's a lot harder to parse a decimal number with a decimal place in it.
It's not clear how to do this with existing UDL support.
--

* Published Documentation (using Standardese?)

  [`johnmcfarlane.github.io/fixed_point/`](http://johnmcfarlane.github.io/fixed_point/)
  
???
I'll be publishing documentation in the next few days.
For now, you can view my old docs from the `fixed_point` library.
They mostly still apply.
